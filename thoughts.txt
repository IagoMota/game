Rendering lists order of iteration(when rendering):
1- background
2- characters and stats(health, mana, etc...)
3- projectiles

every class of entities, background and projectiles
should have a "draw()" method that can be called
to draw it;

whenever a class is instantiated, its constructor
should push a reference of its object into the
apropriate rendering list(array).

the render function should iterate through 
the different rendering lists following
the rendering lists order and calling the "draw()"
method on every list item;
